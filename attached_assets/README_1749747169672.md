# Cast Aloud Farcaster Mini App Integration Files

This directory contains the necessary files for integrating Cast Aloud as a Farcaster Mini App. Here's what each file does:

## Files

1. `.well-known/farcaster.json`
   - The Farcaster Mini App manifest file
   - Contains app metadata and domain verification
   - Note: The `accountAssociation` section needs to be filled with data from Warpcast Desktop

2. `index.html`
   - Updated with Farcaster Frame meta tags
   - Includes OpenGraph tags for social sharing
   - Contains Frame SDK configuration

3. `App.tsx`
   - Modified to initialize the Farcaster Frame SDK
   - Added `sdk.actions.ready()` call in useEffect

## Next Steps

1. Get the account association data from Warpcast Desktop:
   - Open Warpcast Desktop
   - Go to Developer â†’ Mini App Manifest Tool
   - Input domain: castaloud.replit.app
   - Generate association
   - Copy the resulting JSON into the `accountAssociation` section of `farcaster.json`

2. Test the integration:
   - Use Warpcast Debug Tool to verify the frame
   - Check that all meta tags are loading correctly
   - Verify the splash screen appears and disappears properly

3. Deploy the changes:
   - Upload these files to your Replit project
   - Ensure the `.well-known` directory is accessible
   - Test the live deployment
