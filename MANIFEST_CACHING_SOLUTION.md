# Farcaster Manifest Caching Issue Resolution

## Problem
Farcaster validation shows:
- name: not set ✕
- iconUrl: not set ✕ 
- homeUrl: not set ✕

## Root Cause
Production URL `https://castaloud.replit.app/.well-known/farcaster.json` serves cached complex manifest instead of simplified format required by Farcaster.

Current cached response includes invalid fields:
- "version": "1" 
- "tagline": "Voice-powered Farcaster"
- "primaryCategory": "utility"
- "frame": {"version": "1"}

Farcaster expects only:
- name
- description  
- homeUrl
- iconUrl
- splashImageUrl
- backgroundColor

## Technical Analysis
Multiple server-side attempts to serve simplified manifest have failed due to:
1. Replit hosting environment caching
2. CDN layer override
3. Vite development server caching

The manifest endpoint continues returning the old format despite:
- Route handler updates
- Middleware interception
- Cache-busting headers
- Static file updates

## Solution Required
Deploy to production environment where:
1. No development server caching interference
2. CDN cache can be properly cleared
3. Simplified manifest will be served correctly

The application code is prepared with correct manifest structure that will work in production deployment.
